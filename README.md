# MSP-gender-speeches

This repository stores reproducible code for analysing how the proportion of time that MSPs talk in the Scottish Parliament varies by gender. It was adapted from a piece of assessed group work from a Data Science course. The orginal project contained more features and output than is contained in this repository. It can be found as a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lenmetson/speech-time). This repository contains only the R code for analysing speech time of MSPs. 

I use the [ParlScot database](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EQ9WBE) created and maintained by Daniel Braby and Fraser Stewart.

# Reproducibility 
The contents of this repository are fully reproducible at no cost to the user. Because of R's [`here` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/index.html), the code can be run on any machine with any operating system that has [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed. You do not need to change working directories. To reproduce the code, complete the following steps: 

1. Ensure R and RStudio are installed. 
2. Clone the repository to a local folder on your computer. 
3. Open `MSP-gender-speeches.Rproj`. This will open a project in RStudio. Then, within R Studio, open the file `main_script.R` and follow the comments in the code.
